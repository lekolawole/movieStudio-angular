# Introduction

Let's discover **Movie Studio in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new project**.

Or **try Movie Studio immediately** with **[MovieStudio](https://lekolawole.github.io/movieStudio-angular/welcome)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new component

Generate new Components using **Angular's template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
ng generate component movie-card
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:4200/.
